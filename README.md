## Local Install

Clone the repository and set up Python virtual environment:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/OHF-Voice/wyoming-faster-whisper.git
cd wyoming-faster-whisper
script/setup
```

Run a server anyone can connect to:

```sh
script/run --model tiny-int8 --language en --uri 'tcp://0.0.0.0:10300' --data-dir /data --download-dir /data
```

The `--model` can also be a HuggingFace model like `Systran/faster-distil-whisper-small.en`
(but see [Distil-Whisper models are not compatible](#distil-whisper-models-are-not-compatible)
if you want name biasing)

**NOTE**: Models are downloaded to the first `--data-dir` directory.

## Biasing Toward Your Home Assistant Names

Whisper has never heard of your thermostat. "What's the temperature of the Ecobee?"
comes back as "What's the temperature of the incubi?" — the acoustics were fine,
the model just has no reason to think that word exists.

Given a long-lived access token, the server reads the names in your home over the
Home Assistant websocket API and feeds them to the model as a prompt, which fixes
exactly that class of error:

```sh
script/run --uri 'tcp://0.0.0.0:10300' --data-dir /data \
    --hass-token "$TOKEN" --hass-api 'http://homeassistant.local:8123/api'
```

Requires the `hass` extra:

```sh
pip install 'wyoming-faster-whisper[hass]'
```

It collects the names of **conversation-exposed** entities and their aliases, plus
your area and floor names — the names a speaker can actually say. It also reads
which area each exposed entity is in, so the areas you can actually command rank
above the ones you can't. Nothing else is read, and no service is ever called.

The fetch is free in latency terms: it starts when the audio starts, while the
speaker is still talking, and the names are ready by the time the audio stops.
Home Assistant being slow or unreachable only costs freshness — the previous names
are used, or none at all, and the transcript still comes back.

| Option | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--hass-token` | | Long-lived access token. Enables everything above. Use `WYO_WHISPER_HASS_TOKEN_FILE` to keep it off the command line (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)). |
| `--hass-api` | `http://homeassistant.local:8123/api` | Where to find Home Assistant. |
| `--hass-refresh-seconds` | `0` | Minimum seconds between refreshes. `0` refreshes every utterance, so a rename takes effect immediately. |
| `--hass-prompt-max-tokens` | `200` | Token budget for names. Whisper's hard cap is 223 and quality falls off before it. |
| `--hass-prompt-timeout` | `1.0` | How long to wait on an unfinished refresh before transcribing with the names already on hand. |

A large home has more names than the budget holds, so they are added in priority
order and cut off when it runs out:

1. **Areas and floors that hold an exposed entity** — said in nearly every command
   ("turn on the *office* lamp"), and known to be real targets because something
   in them can actually be commanded.
2. **Entity names in the domains people say out loud** — `light`, `switch`, `fan`,
   `media_player`, `climate`, `scene`, `todo`. These are the proper nouns that get
   misheard.
3. **The remaining areas and floors** — sayable, but with nothing exposed in them
   there is no command they can complete.
4. **The remaining entity names** — in a big home mostly sensors, which are
   hundreds in number and usually asked about by area ("the temperature in the
   office") rather than by their own name.

Aliases are not a tier of their own. An alias is what you say *instead of* the
name the integration gave the thing, so each one sits directly behind the name it
belongs to and shares its tier — a light's "standing light" is kept or dropped
along with the light, never left out while lower-priority names get in.

Edit `PRIORITY_DOMAINS` in `wyoming_faster_whisper/hass_api.py` to change what
lands in tier 2. Run with `--debug` to see how many names were dropped and the
exact prompt used. `--initial-prompt` still works and is kept at the front of the
prompt, ahead of anything discovered from Home Assistant.

This biases `faster-whisper` and `qwen3-asr`, the backends that take a prompt.
Others ignore it.

### Distil-Whisper models are not compatible

Distil-Whisper checkpoints (`Systran/faster-distil-whisper-*`, `distil-small.en`,
`distil-large-v3`, …) were distilled without previous-text conditioning, so a
prompt is at best wasted on them and at worst destroys the transcription. This
applies to `--initial-prompt` as much as to `--hass-token`; the server warns at
startup and sends the prompt anyway, since a very short one may be harmless.

Measured on the same clean commands, comparing no prompt against a 29-name
(~97-token) list:

| Model | With a prompt |
| --- | --- |
| `small.en` | Works as intended: `Natalie Sparkly` → `Natalie's Heart Light` |
| `distil-small.en` | Breaks from ~52 prompt tokens on: `avg_logprob` falls below -1.0, every temperature fails, output truncates (`Start a timer for 25 minutes` → `Start a timer.`) or loops (`Add Hot Dog, Hot Dog, Hot Dog, …`) |
| `distil-large-v3` | Inert. No collapse at any size, but no biasing either — `Ecobee` still comes back `EcoBe` with the name in the prompt |

Use a standard Whisper model to bias toward your names.

### Prompt cost on qwen3-asr

For `qwen3-asr` the prompt is not free: the model has to read it before it starts
decoding, at roughly 2.8ms per token, so a 50-name list can double the time for a
short command.

The default model avoids this. The prompt sits ahead of the audio in the chat
template, so its state depends only on the prompt and is computed once, then
reused for every later utterance. The layout is chosen from the files present, so
older model directories with `decoder_init`/`decoder_step` keep working as before
— pass `--model rhasspy/qwen3-asr-0.6b-onnx-int4` to use one.

Measured on a Pi 5 (4 threads, 3.2s command, 50 names):

| | split | merged (default) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| latency | 3.42s | 2.20s |
| peak RSS | 2.25 GB | 1.55 GB |
| on disk | 1407 MB | 785 MB |

The latency win is for short commands. Long-form audio gains little (~1.04x on a
30s clip), because the cached prompt is a small share of that work — though the
memory saving grows with length.

Accuracy is unchanged: on LibriSpeech test-other (n=200) the two produce
byte-identical transcripts with no prompt (5.35% WER for both), and 5.33% vs
5.43% with a 50-name prompt.

## Docker Image

``` sh
docker run -it -p 10300:10300 -v /path/to/local/data:/data rhasspy/wyoming-whisper \
    --model tiny-int8 --language en
```

**NOTE**: Models are downloaded to `/data`, so make sure this points to a Docker volume.

### Health Check

Both images carry a `HEALTHCHECK`, so `docker ps` reports `healthy` or
`unhealthy` and a Compose stack can wait on it with `depends_on:` /
`condition: service_healthy`. It sends the server a `Describe` and requires an
`Info` with an ASR program back, rather than only opening a socket: the port is
bound by the OS, so a connect-only check stays green even when the event loop is
wedged, while a round trip proves the accept loop and the event handler are both
still running.

The first 5 minutes don't count against it, because the server only starts
listening once the model is loaded — which means downloading it on first run —
and it takes 3 consecutive failures to turn the container unhealthy, because
transcription runs on the event loop and a check can time out behind a long
request.

To run it by hand:

``` sh
docker exec whisper \
    /usr/src/.venv/bin/python3 -m wyoming_faster_whisper.health_check
```

It prints nothing and exits 0 when healthy, or prints `unhealthy: <reason>` and
exits 1. That reason is what `docker inspect` shows under `.State.Health`.

The URI it checks is `tcp://127.0.0.1:10300`, or `WYO_WHISPER_URI` when the
container sets one (a listen-everywhere host like `0.0.0.0` is rewritten to
loopback). A `--uri` passed to `docker run` instead of the variable is invisible
to the check, so give it the same one:

```yaml
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "/usr/src/.venv/bin/python3", "-m",
             "wyoming_faster_whisper.health_check",
             "--uri", "tcp://127.0.0.1:10400"]
```

### GPU Image

`Dockerfile.gpu` runs the speech-to-text backends on an NVIDIA GPU. **It is not
published to Docker Hub — you build it yourself**, because it comes out around
10.7 GB (mostly the CUDA torch wheel) against ~1.6 GB for the CPU image, and
Home Assistant OS has no GPU passthrough, so everyone who can use it is already
running Docker directly.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/OHF-Voice/wyoming-faster-whisper.git
cd wyoming-faster-whisper
docker build -f Dockerfile.gpu -t wyoming-whisper:gpu .
```

Running it needs the
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
on the host, and `--gpus`:

``` sh
docker run -it --gpus all -p 10300:10300 -v /path/to/local/data:/data \
    wyoming-whisper:gpu --language en
```

`--device cuda` is the default in this image; pass `--device cuda:1` to pick a
GPU or `--device cpu` to fall back. The default faster-whisper model is
`Systran/faster-whisper-small` (float16) rather than the int8 model used on the
CPU, and a GPU can comfortably run much larger ones:

``` sh
docker run -it --gpus all -p 10300:10300 -v /path/to/local/data:/data \
    wyoming-whisper:gpu --model Systran/faster-whisper-large-v3 --language en
```

Notes and limits:

- **NVIDIA and amd64 only.** CTranslate2, which faster-whisper is built on, has
  no ROCm or Intel XPU backend and publishes no arm64 CUDA wheel. The
  torch-based backends (`--stt-library transformers`, `--stt-library funasr`)
  would work on ROCm or XPU, but that would be a different image.
- **Budget the disk.** ~10.7 GB for the image, plus build cache. Don't build it
  on a Pi by accident.
- **`--stt-library sherpa` runs on the CPU even in this image.** A CUDA
  sherpa-onnx build exists, but sherpa-onnx bundles its own onnxruntime, and two
  CUDA-enabled onnxruntime builds in one process segfault. Its default Parakeet
  models are int8, which the CUDA provider gains little on, so the CPU wheel is
  the better half of that trade.

If `--device cuda` produces no speedup, check the log: the server warns when the
installed onnxruntime or sherpa-onnx build has no usable CUDA support.

### GPU Without Docker

For a local install rather than a container, the two onnxruntime-based backends
have GPU counterparts of their extras — `onnx-asr-gpu` and `qwen3-asr-gpu`,
which pull `onnxruntime-gpu` in place of `onnxruntime`:

``` sh
pip install 'wyoming-faster-whisper[transformers,onnx-asr-gpu,qwen3-asr-gpu]'
```

faster-whisper additionally needs a CUDA-enabled CTranslate2 and torch built for
your CUDA version, and it depends on `onnxruntime` (for its bundled Silero VAD),
which will pull the CPU package back in and clobber `onnxruntime-gpu` — both
install the same `onnxruntime` module and whichever lands second wins, silently,
since the CPU provider still loads every model. Reinstall `onnxruntime-gpu`
last. `Dockerfile.gpu` does exactly this and is the working reference.

## Environment Variables

Every command-line option can also be set from the environment, which is what
Docker Compose gives you to configure a container without rewriting its
`command:`. The variable is the option's name, uppercased, with dashes as
underscores and a `WYO_WHISPER_` prefix:

| Option | Variable |
| --- | --- |
| `--model` | `WYO_WHISPER_MODEL` |
| `--language` | `WYO_WHISPER_LANGUAGE` |
| `--stt-library` | `WYO_WHISPER_STT_LIBRARY` |
| `--hass-token` | `WYO_WHISPER_HASS_TOKEN` |
| ...and so on for every option in `--help` | |

**Precedence**: a command-line argument always wins over the environment, so a
variable left over in a container can never silently override an explicit
argument. A variable that starts with `WYO_WHISPER_` but matches no option is
reported at startup rather than ignored, so a typo doesn't leave the server
running with a default you thought you had changed.

A few options don't take a plain string on the command line, so they read one
specially:

- **Flags** (`--debug`, `--vad-filter`, `--local-files-only`, ...) take
  `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` or `0`/`false`/`no`/`off`/empty. Unlike a plain "is it
  set?" test, `WYO_WHISPER_DEBUG=false` really does mean off.
- **`--data-dir`**, which can be repeated, splits on `:` —
  `WYO_WHISPER_DATA_DIR=/data:/media/models`. Passing any `--data-dir` on the
  command line replaces the list rather than adding to it.
- **`--vad-clip`**, which takes any number of values, splits on commas or
  spaces. Empty means the flag with no values, i.e. every library.
- **`--zeroconf`**, whose value is optional, takes the name to announce, or
  empty for the default name.

Any other variable left empty means the same as not setting it at all, which is
what a compose file or a `.env` produces for a value whose author left it blank.
An empty `WYO_WHISPER_URI` gets you argparse's "the following arguments are
required", not a server that starts up and fails on an empty string.

### Secrets

Each variable also has a `_FILE` form naming a file to read the value out of:
`WYO_WHISPER_HASS_TOKEN_FILE=/run/secrets/hass_token`. That is the convention
Docker Compose and Swarm secrets use — a secret is mounted as a file rather than
handed over as a variable — and it keeps a long-lived Home Assistant token out
of both the process's command line and its environment. The file is preferred
over the plain variable when both are set, and its trailing newline is stripped.

```yaml
services:
  whisper:
    image: rhasspy/wyoming-whisper
    ports:
      - "10300:10300"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      WYO_WHISPER_MODEL: tiny-int8
      WYO_WHISPER_LANGUAGE: en
      WYO_WHISPER_HASS_API: http://homeassistant.local:8123/api
      WYO_WHISPER_HASS_TOKEN_FILE: /run/secrets/hass_token
    secrets:
      - hass_token

secrets:
  hass_token:
    file: ./secrets/hass_token.txt
```

In the Docker image, `--uri`, `--data-dir`, and `--device` have defaults baked
into the entrypoint; those are dropped when the matching variable is set, so
`WYO_WHISPER_URI` and friends work there too.
