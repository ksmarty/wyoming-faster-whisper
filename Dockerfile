# Keep every cache on the /data volume instead of the container's filesystem.
# Model files already go there (--download-dir defaults to the first --data-dir),
# but the libraries also write caches that no per-call argument reaches: the Xet
# chunk cache used during hub downloads is $HF_HOME/xet and can run to several
# GB, and torch/others fall back to $XDG_CACHE_HOME. Unset, all of that lands in
# $HOME/.cache - which is thrown away on every container recreate, and is an
# unwritable /.cache when the container runs as a uid with no passwd entry.
#
# These have to be environment variables: huggingface_hub reads them into
# constants at import time, so setting them from Python would be too late.

# transcription runs on the event loop, so a check can time out behind a long
# request without the server being unhealthy.
