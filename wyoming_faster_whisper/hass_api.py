"""Read the names in a Home Assistant install over the websocket API.

Read-only and recognition-only: this fetches the names a speaker can actually
say -- exposed entities, the areas and floors they live in -- and never calls a
service or handles an intent. The result is a
[RecognitionContext](vocabulary.py) that biases speech-to-text.

Only *conversation-exposed* entities are collected. Every entity in the house
would put hundreds of names the speaker cannot mean into a prompt with room for
a few dozen, crowding out the ones they can.

Even so, an exposed home can overrun the prompt budget on its own, so the names
are also sorted into the priority tiers of a
[RecognitionContext](vocabulary.py): which area holds something exposed, and
which domain an entity belongs to, are both known only here.

Requires the ``hass`` extra (aiohttp).
