"""Translation of the --device option into each backend's own vocabulary.

There is one user-facing device string, but the backends disagree on how to name
hardware: CTranslate2 and sherpa-onnx take "cpu"/"cuda", torch takes
"cpu"/"cuda"/"cuda:1", and onnxruntime takes an ordered list of execution
providers. Resolving that in one place keeps the string-sniffing out of the five
handlers, and keeps the rules testable without any backend installed.

Accepted values are "cpu", "cuda", and "cuda:N". Anything else is passed through
unchanged to the torch- and CTranslate2-based backends (so "auto", "mps", or
"xpu" still reach the library that understands them) and treated as CPU for the
onnxruntime-based ones, which need an explicit provider list.
